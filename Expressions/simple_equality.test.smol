/*
Description: Really simple equality

These tests are from probably the first test that I wrote in .net to test the basics of
parsing and executing the simplest instructions. They probably don't have much value now
but they don't hurt being here.

Steps:
- Run
- Expect global a1 to be boolean true
- Expect global b1 to be boolean false
- Expect global a2 to be boolean true
- Expect global b2 to be boolean false
- Expect global a3 to be boolean true
- Expect global b3 to be boolean false
- Expect global a4 to be boolean true
- Expect global b4 to be boolean true
- Expect global a5 to be boolean true
- Expect global b5 to be boolean false
- Expect global a6 to be boolean true
- Expect global b6 to be boolean true
- Expect global a7 to be boolean true
- Expect global b7 to be boolean false

var a1 = (1 == 1);
var b1 = (1 == 2);
var a2 = (1 != 2);
var b2 = (1 != 1);
var a3 = (2 > 1);
var b3 = (1 > 2);
var a4 = (2 >= 1);
var b4 = (1 >= 1);
var a5 = (1 < 2);
var b5 = (2 < 1);
var a6 = (1 <= 2); 
var b6 = (1 <= 1);
var a7 = (!false);
var b7 = (!true);
