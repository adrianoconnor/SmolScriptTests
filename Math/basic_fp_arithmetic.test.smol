Description: Validate basic math operations with decimal places

I am not sure how well all of this fp business is going to hold up -- apparently in Jest we're supposed
to use toBeCloseTo with decimal precision of say, 5 -- rather than toBe, because floats quite often don't
end up being equal... but for now this test is passing so no need to change :)

If we do change we'll need to just tweak the test runner to spot the decimal place and do the alternative thing.

Steps:
- Run
- Expect global _add to be number 4.109999999999999
- Expect global _subtract to be number 3.1000000000000005
- Expect global _power to be number 22.290739923588102
- Expect global _mul to be number 0.55
- Expect global _div to be number 52.5
- Expect global _remainder to be number 1.5
*/

var _add = 2.1 + 2.01;
var _subtract = 6.11 - 3.01;
var _power = 4.1 ** 2.2;
var _mul = 5.5 * 0.1;
var _div = 10.5/0.2;
var _remainder = 10.5%3;
