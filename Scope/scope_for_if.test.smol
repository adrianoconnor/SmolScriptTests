/*
Description: Test that scope works as expected with nested if statements

#Â node-vm-skip-test

We skip this test in node because the inner var would need to be 'let' to get the same
behavior as smol. In node the final value of global a would be 3.

Steps:
- Run
- expect global a to be number 1
- expect global b to be number 3
*/ 

var a = 1;
var b = 0;

if (a == 1) {
  var a = 2;
  if (a == 2) {
    a = 3;
    b = a;
  }
}
